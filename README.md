# htmlSnake
A Snake game made using HTML, Javascript and CSS.

This uses CSS Grid and Javascript to recreate snake instead of the common method of using HTML Canvas.

It's pretty barebones and doesn't include HUD Elements to track score, time, etc.

Uses a modular way of loading JS files, instead of dumping everything in a single JS file, by exporting/importing relevant functions and variables.
